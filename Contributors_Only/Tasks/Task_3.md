For this task, using the RNGs you had created earlier, create a uniform distribution. Once that is done, transform the uniform distribution to the distribution assigned to you using any known transformation methods. The distributions must all be written in C++ in accordance with the generic distribution classes under the **distribution.h** file. Pick the approriate class (continuous or discrete) from that file depending on your distribution.
